# Sprites

Digital creatures formed or summoned out of the resonance. In play, they are personas without devices, a jumble of code that shouldn't work but does. They are as smart as agents, which is not very. They cannot be parts of a PAN or WAN.

A compiled sprite starts with an OS of 0 and the OS increase due to time starts right away. If a sprite is converged upon, it is destroyed regardless of remaining tasks, and the demiGOD gets the sprite's technomancer's location (same with a "trace icon" test).

A sprite's device rating and resonance are both equal to is level, and its Matrix attributes are based on level and sprite type. It has a Matrix condition monitor of 8 + (level / 2) boxes. It's initiative is based on level and type.

A technomancer can only have 1 compiled sprit at a time.

A conscious technomancer always knows where their sprites are. If the technomancer goes unconscious, their sprites will finish the last action they were assigned. After this, compiled sprites will return to the resonance, tasks depleted, and registered sprites will hang out waiting for the technomancer.

## Tasks

The initial compiling test determines how many tasks the new sprite owns its technomancer - equal to the technomancer's net hits on the test.

## Registering

A compiled sprite can be registered on the Matrix to stick around longer and perform more intricate tasks. The "register sprite" resonance action takes a number of hours equal to the sprite's level, during which the sprite's OS does not increase from time, and neither it nor the technomancer can do anything else. Successful completion means the sprite is now registered and its OS is now 0.

A registered sprite's OS operates just like any hacker - it starts ticking only upon the first illegal action.

### Compiled tasks

* Single use of one of its powers (spend an additional task if you modify how it's being used)
* One combat turn worth of Matrix actions
* Participation in combat until it's over

Compiled sprites, upon completion of a remote task, return to the resonance.

### Registered tasks

* All tasks a non-register sprite can do
* Give a bonus of level in dice to learn a new complex form (single form)
* Give a bonus of level in dice to thread a complex form (single test)
* Sustain a complex form, taking the -2 penalty, for level of combat turns, upon which you either take the penalty yourself, spend another task, or let the complex form fade
* Perform a number of tasks given to another persona
* Return to the resonance, awaiting further instruction
* Re-register for more tasks

Compiled sprites, upon completion of a remote task, return to the technomancer.

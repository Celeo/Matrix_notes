# Hosts

Hosts are cloud computing, spread over the entire globe on a specific grid. Hosts are reachable without noise penalties from distance. When inside a host, you can communicate with other icons inside the host without noise from distance, but cannot communicate with icons outside of it, with the exception of the "send message" action, and the inverse is also true. Hosts have IC and often have Matrix security personnel called spiders.

## Archives

Hosts can store files in archives, where it cannot (for the most part) be accessed by hackers. A *registered* user must fetch the file from the archive.

## Attributes

Hosts all have a rating from 1 to 12. They also have the four Matrix attributes, which are ranked at rating, rating + 1, rating + 2, and rating + 3, where the assignment is selected by the host itself. These attributes are shared by all of the host's IC.

## Convergence

OS continues to climb while inside a host (assuming you've done something illegal or do so while inside). When you hit the limit, the host gets 3 marks on you and starts launching IC. If you exit the host, GOD converges on you, so jack out from inside the host.

## IC

Each IC program has a persona with its own condition monitor and initiative score, and is in hot-sim VR. IC use the Matrix attributes of their host. The host and IC share marks, so if a hacker gets a mark on one IC program, the hacker gets marks on all IC programs and the host itself, but the opposite is also true for spotting hackers.

A host can launch 1 IC per combat turn, at the start, can have its rating in active IC running at any time, and can't launch more than 1 of any single type at once. Destroying an IC program means the host will likely launch it at the start of the next combat turn.

The only IC running 24/7 usually is Patrol IC.

### Types

All IC have an attack of `Host rating * 2 [Attack] v. Firewall + WIL` except for Patrol IC, which doesn't have an attack.

#### Acid

When it gets 1 or more net hits on an attack, it lowers your Firewall by 1 (cumulative). If your Firewall is 0 and it gets another net hit, it causes 1 DV of damage per net hit. Firewall reduction lasts until you reboot.

#### Binder

Same as Acid but for Data Processing.

#### Black

On a hit, it link-locks you and causes damage equal to (Attack rating) + (1 * net hit) + (2 * marks) **along with** and equal amount of biofeedback damage.

#### Blaster

Like Black IC, but the biofeedback damage is only stun.

#### Crash

On a hit where it has you marked, one of your programs (at random) crashes.

#### Jammer

Like Acid and Binder IC, but for Attack.

#### Killer

Like Blaster, but no biofeedback damage - just the Matrix damage.

#### Marker

Like Acid/Binder/Jammer but for Sleaze.

#### Patrol

Uses Matrix perception actions to look for personas making illegal actions inside the host.

*Note*: Once you're inside a host, you're legally there, until you do something illegal.

#### Probe

Gets another mark on the target on a hit (up to 3; marks are shared amongst the host and all IC).

#### Scramble

If it hits when the host has 3 marks on you, you are forcibly rebooted.

#### Sparky

Like Blaster, but without link-locking.

#### Tar baby

Link-locks on a hit, unless you're already link-locked, in which case it gets a mark on you.

#### Track

If it hits and has 2 or more marks on you, the host and its owners get your physical location.

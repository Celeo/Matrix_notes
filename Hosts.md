# Hosts

Hosts are cloud computing, spread over the entire globe on a specific grid. Hosts are reachable without noise penalties from distance. When inside a host, you can communicate with other icons inside the host without noise from distance, but cannot communicate with icons outside of it, with the exception of the "send message" action, and the inverse is also true. Hosts have IC and often have Matrix security personnel called spiders.

## Archives

Hosts can store files in archives, where it cannot (for the most part) be accessed by hackers. A *registered* user must fetch the file from the archive.

## Attributes

Hosts all have a rating from 1 to 12. They also have the four Matrix attributes, which are ranked at rating, rating + 1, rating + 2, and rating + 3, where the assignment is selected by the host itself. These attributes are shared by all of the host's IC.

## Convergence

OS continues to climb while inside a host (assuming you've done something illegal or do so while inside). When you hit the limit, the host gets 3 marks on you and starts launching IC. If you exit the host, GOD converges on you, so jack out from inside the host.

## IC

Each IC program has a persona with its own condition monitor and initiative score, and is in hot-sim VR. IC use the Matrix attributes of their host. The host and IC share marks, so if a hacker gets a mark on one IC program, the hacker gets marks on all IC programs and the host itself, but the opposite is also true for spotting hackers.

A host can launch 1 IC per combat turn, at the start, can have its rating in active IC running at any time, and can't launch more than 1 of any single type at once. Destroying an IC program means the host will likely launch it at the start of the next combat turn.

The only IC running 24/7 usually is Patrol IC.

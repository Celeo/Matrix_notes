# Agents

Autonomous programs. Are rated from 1 to 6. Running an agent requires a program slot on a cyberdeck. Agents use the deck's Matrix attributes, their rating for (standard) attributes, and Computer/Hacking/Cybercombat skills equal to their rating. Agents can also use other running programs on the deck. Agents use the deck's Matrix condition monitor, and don't have their own OS, but do have their own persona and icon.
